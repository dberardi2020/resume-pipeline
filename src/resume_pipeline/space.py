"""The layout design space: enumerate it, measure it, name it.

The space is finite, deterministic, and a product of independent categorical axes,
which is the property everything else here leans on. It means the space can simply
be *enumerated* and browsed with the axes as facets — "every layout in this palette",
"this layout in any palette but this one" — so there is no recommender, no sampling
seed, and no session state to keep. A catalogue answers what a search engine would.

Distance is therefore Hamming: the number of axes on which two specs disagree, 0-6.
Crude, but it matches how the choices behave — swapping a palette changes exactly one
thing, and the metric should say exactly that. It underwrites `spread` (show me the
range), `neighbours` (show me the near-misses), and the merge of two specs, which is
just the sub-space they span.

Kept free of rendering and IO, so it can be reasoned about and tested on its own.
