"""A static, browsable catalogue of layouts.

`serve` is the same viewer with a process behind it. A catalogue needs no process:
it is a folder you open in a browser, commit, link, or hand to someone else — and a
`file://` path outlives a localhost URL.

The output is self-contained and works from `file://` — no server, no build step.
