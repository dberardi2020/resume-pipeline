"""Print HTML to PDF using an installed Chrome, via its headless CLI.

Chrome has shipped `--headless --print-to-pdf` for years, which makes a browser
automation dependency (and the Node runtime under it) unnecessary — the whole
pipeline stays stdlib-plus-a-browser-you-already-have.

Chrome is located rather than configured. The original script hardcoded a Windows
path, which is precisely why it could not run on a Mac; discovery costs a few
lines and removes a whole class of "works on my machine".
