"""Writing the deliverable — the one file set you actually send.

Kept out of the CLI because two surfaces publish: the `publish` command, and the
viewer's "make this my resume". They must write the same names to the same place,
or a workspace ends up with two competing answers to "which file do I send?".

A resume folder should answer that instantly, so publishing overwrites one fixed
set of names rather than accumulating layout-suffixed variants.

Two publish choices — *which layout* and *which formats* — are remembered in a
small hidden sidecar (`.resume-pipeline.json`) beside the deliverable, so a later
content edit can re-publish the same design without the caller restating it. The
sidecar rather than the deliverable itself, so the choice survives deleting every
generated file; folder-local rather than a global config, so it rides the same
sync and each folder (a tailored application, say) remembers its own.
