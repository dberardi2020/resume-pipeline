"""PDF export, and the claim that matters about it.

A resume that renders beautifully and extracts as garbage is worse than useless,
because the failure is invisible to the person sending it. So this does not check
that a PDF was produced — it re-extracts the text and asserts the content survived
the round trip, which is exactly what a parser on the other end will do.

Skipped rather than failed where the machine cannot run it: PDF needs a
Chromium-family browser, and extraction needs PyMuPDF.
